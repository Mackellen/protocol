<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>PlankFit</strong> ("the App") handles user information.
The App is developed and published by an individual developer.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

<p>
The App <strong>does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>No account registration is required</li>
    <li>No personal information is requested</li>
    <li>No analytics or tracking tools are used</li>
    <li>No third-party SDKs collect user data</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>

<p>
All exercise-related data (such as plank duration, training settings, and exercise results)
is stored <strong>locally on the user's device only</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This data is used solely to provide basic functionality within the App and is never uploaded,
synced, or shared with any external servers or third parties.
</p>

<h2>3. Network Usage</h2>

<p>
The App does <strong>not</strong> require an internet connection to function and does not transmit
any data over the network.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

<p>
The App does <strong>not share any data</strong> with third parties.

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

Since no personal or sensitive data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data leakage
through external systems. All locally stored data remains on the user's device.
</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>
The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
</p>

<h2>7. User Rights</h2>
